# Pacman Remake

![pacman_low_res](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95af5bd5-c94c-4c8a-993f-a69d3e88c198)

This is my first ever application built from scratch!

I decided to build the app using pure Java code, as that's the only language I was fully comfortable with at the time.
I tried to keep the game as close to the original as possible, though there are a few elements I failed to cover.
I also remade all of the pixel art myself (aside from the background) since I figured it would be fun - those files can be found in the res package.
Overall, from start to finish (i.e. fully funcitoning app), the project took me roughly 4 week to complete, though I may update the repo from time to time.

STARTING THE GAME:
1.) download the source code
2.) open source code inside an IDE of your choice (I built the app using IntelliJ IDEA, but you can also use something like VSCode for example)
3.) run the file "Main.java" (found inside the main package, which is located in the src directory)

Hope you enjoy!
